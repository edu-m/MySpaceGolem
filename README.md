# SpaceGOLEM

Help the GOLEM mascot drive the spaceship in this single-player turn-based game

## Commands

- **Movement**: to drive the spaceship, press the **WASD** keys (if you are a gamer) or the **HJKL** keys (if you are a vimmer)
- **Waiting/Laser**: to do nothing, press **enter**. If you are aiming to the mineral, the spaceship will automatically shoot a laser.
- **Confirmation**: to confirm a command, press the same key again

## How to play

For now, this is just a demo. Move the spaceship in the direction of the green mineral, then shoot a laser, pick the now broken mineral, take it back to the base, repeat. Avoid crashing on asteroids, they will make you explode and then more asteroids will be added.
